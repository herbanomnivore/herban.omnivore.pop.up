            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Herban Omnivore is my love letter to all the senses—an intimate space shaped by food, music, writing, and storytelling. Together, we explore how traditional art forms (i.e. fine dining, classical music) can be reimagined as accessible, interdisciplinary, and multi-sensory experiences that foster community dialougue and personal introspection. As a classical musician, I am particularly inspired by a new generation that seeks meaning beyond performance and prestige, embracing creativity, curiosity, and connection.</p>

<p>What began as a student-run pop-up kitchen has grown into an creative platform that celebrates sensory-driven art that encourages slow and intentional experiential thinking--whether it's an interactive tasting menu, a concert, or a multisensory pairing. </p>

    <h2>✨ Philosophy</h2>
                    
 <p> Herban Omnivore's culinary vision is globally inspired yet rooted in my Taiwanese cultural heritage--with humble local and seasonal produce under the spotlight. Plant-centrism is not a declaration of veganism, but rather a quiet rebellion against the notion that brilliance in fine dining must be rooted in capitalistic extravagance and materialism. Instead of exclusive ingredients, indulgence can come from creative stimuli, sensory curiosity, community gathering, and spiritual nourishment. I have also done 100% plant-based and zero-waste centered events! You can check them out in my <a href="#events">Event Gallery.</a>

                   <p>
    Every event is also paired with a zine I design myself—sharing the intentions and rationale behind each creation, stories and memories that shaped the dishes, and sometimes stylistic writing or drawings. For pure food events, these zines offer space for deeper reflection and often spark conversations around our food system and the role of artists in shaping cultural, ecological, and emotional sustainability. For food & art immersive events, these zines encourage a moment of pause—a gentle invitation to observe, reflect, and attune to our senses. They serve as quiet companions to the experience, advocating for slow thinking in a world of rapid distractions. Through them, we reclaim space for introspection, acknowledge how perception shapes identity and place, and resist the flattening effects of anti-intellectualism by celebrating emotional depth, curioisty, and embodied knowledge.

                <h3><i>Classical Recital Meets Tasting Menu: An Immersive, Multisensory, and Interactive Evening of Music, Food, and Story.</i>
</h3>
                <p>Our next edition of Savoring the Score traces love in all its forms, from grief and passion, romance and ambition, to transformation and farewell. Each pairing embodies a chapter of love, unfolding as a journey through the chambers of the heart. Together, the program embraces imperfection, complexity, and transience, asking us to savor love not as perfection, but as a journey, tender, flawed, bittersweet, and luminous.</p>

                <p>More than just a tasting menu, the experience is interactive: guests are invited to engage with their food, add finishing touches, and quite literally shape their own journey. Through these moments of play and reflection, Savoring the Score invites us to savor love not as a fixed ideal, but as something lived, felt in layers, held in tension, and ultimately, shared.</p>

                <h3>Savoring the Score - Pilot Event</h3>
                <p><i>***Special thanks to the <a href="https://www.womensfacultyclub.com/" target="_blank">Women's Faculty Club</a> at UC Berkeley for the making our pilot event come true via the Arts in the Afternoon Program.***</i></p>
                  <p> Muisc x Food. Traditionally, classical concert halls have long been spaces of quiet etiquette and reverent listenimg. Meanwhile, food traditionally occupies spaces like restaurants and markets—areas often filled with ambient sounds, but not typically designed for intentional listening. At Savoring the Score, we blur these boundaries by creating an immersive environment where the music and food are experienced as interwoven parts of a holistic sensory journey.

<p>The programming and menu design reflect our dedication to sensory storytelling. Together with pianist Vanness Yu, we performed six violin & piano pieces alongside guided commentary. each piece is paired with an original dish that translates musical elements into flavors, textures, and sensory narratives. These pairings are crafted to evoke specific memories, emotions, and sensory impressions, guiding the audience through a cohesive arc of storytelling.

                   <p>The pilot event was themed upon seasonality and transformation. Just as the seasons shape our world, changes define our journeys. Whether you are a college student navigating identity and aspirations or someone in any stage of life facing conflict and yearning, this evening is meant to inspire introspection—a moment to pause, listen, taste, and engage in a conversation with your senses and intuition. </p>

    <h3>Fall/Winter 2024 - Echoes at the Crossroads</h3>
    <p>This interactive menu was designed to take you on a reflective journey of personal emotions and memories regarding your college experience. You will get to think about, play with, and "choose" what you eat. For your timeless birthday of constant transformation, you make a silent wish to a fermented soy butter candle, smothering warm comfort onto layers of crispy aspirations. For a dish that represents homesickness, you get to spray different "essences of home" (mom's cooking, friend's laughter, home bed, etc.) onto your egg in a nest. As a sweet note of farewell, you sprinkle "fear powder" onto your golden bridge, enjoy your sweet treat while "cracking" and devouring your fears. Curated right in front of a cozy open kitchen, this menu invites you to digest the bittersweet flavors of growth, identity, belonging, and transformation.</p>

                <p>Night Market x Dining Table featured a fully plant-based menu capturing the whimsical marriage of bold street food flavors and humble gastronomical traditions in Taiwan. The menu reconciles traditions with new experiences, spotlighting nostalgic Taiwanese flavors--from street food to banquet delights--with an emphasis on local Californian seasonal produce. Vegan versions of traditional condiments (shacha, oyster sauce, XO sauce, dobanjiang, etc.) were made from scratch. Techniques like fermentation and ingredients like soy were spotlighted as an origin of discourses regarding how culture plays a role in what constitutes as sustainable cuisine.</p>

                <p>This 10-course menu was crafted through the lens of my hometown: Taipei. An array of farm fresh local summer produce hand-selected from traditional farmers' in Taiwan married with housemade traditional Taiwanese condimets and ferments, all presented through a global culinary narrative. Zero-waste fine dining was emphasized, in which all parts of one whole chicken and all vegetable scraps were utilized and reinvented into different dishes. Each guest was given a handrawn mini zine that highlights Taiwanese local produce and introduces the though process and stories bind each dish.

            <h2>Meet the Creator</h2>
            <p>Phoebe Wu is a rising senior at UC Berkeley, double majoring in Economics and Music with a minor in Food Systems. A passionate performer, she served as concertmaster of the California Orchestra Institute in 2024, and is currently a first violinist in the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra . In February 2025, she performed the Butterfly Lovers Concerto with the orchestra upon winning the concerto competition. Her recent honors include the Roselyn Schneider Eisner Prize for artistic excellence and the Bernece Lyon Prize for creative innovation.</p>

            <p>Phoebe’s classical training began in Taipei, where she was principal second violinist of the Taipei Philharmonic Youth Ensemble. In 2016, she made her soloist debut with the group and later held three solo charity recitals at Taiwan’s National Recital Hall (2018, 2021, 2024), donating proceeds to Angel’s Heart Family Social Welfare Foundation. Her recent awards include 1st prize in the Charleston International Music Competition (2024), 1st prize at the International Schubert Competition Vienna (2025), and 2nd prize at the International Mozart Competition Vienna (2025).</p>

                    <img src="recital.jpg"alt = "Phoebe Wu playing the violin">
                </div>   

            <p>Her musical path, however, has always been deeply entwined with a love for storytelling, community, and cultural exploration. In 2021, she performed alongside Ray Chen and Taiwan’s National Symphony Orchestra to bring classical music to indigenous communities. That same year, she co-founded Saplings of Music, a charity initiative that raised over 500,000 NTD and collected 45 instruments to provide free music education to underserved children in Taipei.</p>

            <p>This belief in music as a bridge between people, cultures, and ideas would later evolve into Herban Omnivore—a creative platform Phoebe launched in 2023 that blends food, music, and storytelling into immersive, sensory experiences. Drawing on her Taiwanese roots, artistic training, and interest in sustainable food systems, she designs events that explore the emotional and cultural power of flavor and sound.</p>

                </div>   

            <p>Her recent project, Savoring the Score, is a multi-course recital-tasting that pairs uniquely-crafted dishes with live violin and piano works. Each course mirrors or contrasts a musical piece, inviting audiences to reflect, feel, and engage across senses. The experience is accompanied by an original zine that weaves together prose, sketches, and musings on seasonality, transformation, and memory. Today, Phoebe continues to explore how creative expression can nourish reflection and connection. </p>
