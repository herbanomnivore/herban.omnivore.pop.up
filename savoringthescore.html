      <h1>Savoring the Score: Recital Meets Tasting Menu</h1>
      <p><i>Special thanks to the Women's Faculty Club at Berkeley for making this event possible through the Arts in the Afternoon Program.</i></p>

      <p>
        <strong>Music x Food.</strong> This event is an experimental exploration of something Iâ€™ve been thinking about for a whileâ€”the relationship between our senses, especially in a slow, artistically-driven setting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, classical concert halls have long been spaces of quiet etiquette and reverent listening. Meanwhile, food occupies spaces like restaurants and marketsâ€”areas filled with ambient sounds, but not typically designed for intentional listening. <strong>Savoring the Score</strong> blurs these boundaries by creating an immersive environment where music and food are experienced as interwoven parts of a holistic sensory journey.

        The programming and menu design reflect our dedication to artistic storytelling and sensory molding. Each piece was thoughtfully selected, then individually paired with an originally crafted dish. Each pairing makes statements about complementary rhythms, textures, and harmonic essences â€” while also evoking memories and emotions that build into a thematic narrative.

        The pilot event was themed around <strong>seasonality and transformation</strong>. Just as the seasons shape our world, changes define our journeys. Whether you are a college student navigating identity and aspirations, or someone in any stage of life facing conflict and yearning â€” this evening is meant to inspire introspection. A moment to pause, listen, taste, and engage in a conversation with your senses and intuition.
